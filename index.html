    <!-- My Paragraphs (2) -->
    <p>
      Malik Wensman is a student at <strong>NC State University</strong> in
      Raleigh, NC. He is a Freshman, but has enough credits making him qualify
      as a <em>Sophmore</em> in MyPack. He will graduate in 2026. He chose the
      major of <ins>Mechanical Engineering</ins> because he believes it will
      allow him to build great machines in his future.

      and not be allowed to take any <ins>free</ins> food home. His dream job is
      to be an <em>entreprenuer</em> with a business that creates machines that
      will <em>impact peoples lives in a positive way</em>.
